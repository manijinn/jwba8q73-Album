Known as "PlaceFolio". This is a prototype of a web-application that stores a user's photos onto a map, where the user can place a pin indicating where the user has taken their photo. It's essentially a geo-based photo album, designed around MERN stack. I worked on this with a team, where I was part of the backend development team. The prototype is finished, and works!

This particular repository was restructured by a teammate who led the frontend development. Node Modules were removed from the repository to save space.
